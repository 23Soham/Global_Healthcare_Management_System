## Background
Due to today's fast-paced lifestyle, people move frequently, whether they are traveling or just moving around. This makes it difficult to keep and transport physical medical data records and prevents individuals from receiving optimal care. Hospitals, doctors, and patients can diagnose and treat ailments more promptly and efficiently when remote and on-demand access to patient data is made possible.

## Mission Statement
The mission is to leverage database management systems to enable the quickest, most flexible access to medical records worldwide, with the goal of inspiring and promoting health and well-being.

## Objectives
- **Effective Patient Care and Management**: Optimize the delivery of patient care through the integration of several processes, including patient registration, medical history management, treatment planning. This comprehensive approach seeks to enhance efficiency and ensure a smooth and uninterrupted healthcare experience for patients.
- **Centralized Health Records**: Establish a standardized and centralized electronic health record system that enables authorized medical personnel to safely access patient data from any location.
- **Observance and Guidelines Adherence**: Adhere to global healthcare standards, rules, and data privacy legislation, protecting patient privacy and data security internationally.
- **Data Analytics and Insights**: Allow research teams and sophisticated analytics tools to extract valuable information from Electronic Health Records and financial activities, supporting trend analysis, resource allocation, and well-informed decision-making.
- **Financial Management**: Assist in the processing of insurance claims, revenue cycle management, and expense analysis to facilitate efficient financial management. Its goals are to cut administrative costs and streamline the reimbursement process.
- **Remote Patient Monitoring**: Incorporate patient tracking and records to monitor patients remotely, ensuring that healthcare reaches people in rural or underdeveloped areas.

## Scope
The Global Healthcare Management System aims to transform how healthcare is delivered worldwide. This system will help healthcare professionals securely access patient data irrespective of geographical location while ensuring privacy and confidentiality. Key areas of focus include patient data visualization and insights from healthcare operations and financial transactions. The system will incorporate various healthcare processes and tasks, including:
- Registration and administration of patients
- Management of medical history
- Care coordination and treatment tracking through EHRs (Electronic Health Records)
- Processing insurance claims

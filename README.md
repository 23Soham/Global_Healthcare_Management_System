# Global_Healthcare_Management_System

##BACKGROUND:

Due to today's fast-paced lifestyle, people move frequently, whether they are traveling or just moving around. This makes it difficult to keep and transport physical medical data records and keeps people from getting the best care possible. Hospitals, doctors, and patients can diagnose and treat patients more promptly and efficiently when remote and on-demand access to patient data is made possible.

##MISSION STATEMENT:

Our mission is to use database management systems to enable the quickest, most flexible access to medical records worldwide, with the goal of inspiring and promoting health and well-being.

##OBJECTIVES:

Effective Patient Care and Management: The primary objective of this system is to optimize the delivery of patient care through the integration of several processes, including patient registration, medical history management, treatment planning, etc. This comprehensive approach seeks to enhance efficiency and ensure a smooth and uninterrupted healthcare experience for patients.

Centralized Health Records: The system guarantees a standardised and centralised electronic health record system that enables authorised medical personnel to safely access patient data from any location.

 
Observance and Guidelines Adherence: The system ensures adherence to global healthcare standards, rules, and data privacy legislation, protecting patient privacy and data security internationally.

 
Data analytics and insights: The system is designed to let research teams and sophisticated analytics tools draw valuable information from Electronic Health Records, and financial activities. As a result, these tools will support trend analysis, resource allocation, and well-informed decision-making. All of it will be done in accordance with all laws, protecting patient privacy.
 

Financial Management: The system aids in the processing of insurance claims, revenue cycle management, and expense analysis, thereby facilitating efficient financial management. Its goals are to cut administrative costs and streamline the reimbursement process.

 

Remote Patient Monitoring: By incorporating patient tracking and records, healthcare providers can keep an eye on patients from a distance, guaranteeing that people in rural or underdeveloped areas have access to medical care.

 

This Global Health Management System seeks to transform healthcare delivery globally and ultimately enhance people's general health and well-being by adopting cutting-edge technologies, utilizing data analytics, and emphasizing patient-centric care.



##SCOPE:

This system will help healthcare professionals to access patient data securely, irrespective of geographical location. This system also makes sure about the privacy and confidentiality aspect of healthcare across the globe. We would also focus on the visualizations aspect to derive insights from patient data, healthcare operations, and financial transactions.
